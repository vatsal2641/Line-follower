# Line-follower

Introduction:

A line follower robot is a type of autonomous robot that can follow a line on the ground without any human intervention. The robot is equipped with 5 infrared sensors that enable it to detect the line and make decisions about its movement. In this README file, we will provide you with a basic understanding of the line follower robot and how to use it.

Getting Started:

To build a line follower robot, you will need a robot kit that includes components such as IR sensors, a microcontroller, motor drivers, and motors. You will need to assemble these components according to the instructions provided with your kit.

Once your robot is assembled, you will need to program the arduino using arduino IDE. You will need to use the algorithms that enable the robot to detect the line and follow it.

Programming the Robot:

The programming of the robot is the most important step in building a line follower robot. Here are the basic steps involved in programming a line follower robot:

Initialize the sensors: You will need to initialize the sensors of the robot. The sensors will enable the robot to detect the line.

Read the sensor values: You will need to read the sensor values and determine the position of the line relative to the robot.

Make decisions about movement: Once the position of the line is determined, you will need to make decisions about the movement of the robot. You can use algorithms such as "proportional control" or "PID control" to make decisions about the movement.

Move the robot: You will need to move the robot along the line. You can use the motor drivers to control the movement of the robot.

Repeat: You will need to repeat steps 2 to 4 until the robot reaches the end of the line.

Testing the Robot:

Once you have programmed your robot, you will need to test it to ensure that it is working properly. You can test the robot by placing it on a line and seeing how it follows the line.

Conclusion:

Building a line follower robot can be a fun and challenging experience. By following the steps outlined in this README file, you can build and program your own line follower robot. Remember to take your time and be patient, and you will be able to build a robot that can follow any line.
